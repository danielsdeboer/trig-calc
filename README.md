A simple trigonometry calculator built with jQuery. This is a kind of specific thing to the cutting tool industry, but it's available for anyone to use and change as they wish.

This is built with Bourbon and Neat, though it doesn't really leverage their functionality all that much and could be easily removed if desired.

The CSS is generated from a SCSS file, which is provided.
